## Introduction

This is the backend component of YourFood, an innovative online food application that caters to all your culinary cravings. The backend is built using Python and Flask, offering reliable and efficient handling of user orders and interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend is primarily developed using the Python programming language, known for its simplicity and versatility.
- **Flask**: Flask is used as the web framework for building the backend API. Its lightweight nature and simplicity make it ideal for this project.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQLAlchemy is utilized as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for interacting with the database and handling data operations.
- **Flask-Migrate**: Flask-Migrate provides database migration capabilities, allowing for seamless database schema changes during the development process.
- **Flask-Login**: Flask-Login is used for user authentication, enabling secure and straightforward login functionality.
- **Flask-CORS**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is integrated to handle cross-origin requests and enable frontend-backend communication.
- **Flask-SocketIO**: Flask-SocketIO is used to implement real-time features, such as order status updates and chat functionalities.
- **SMTP**: For email functionality, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is utilized to send OTP (One-Time Password) for verification purposes.
